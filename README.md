## Bonus Points
  - I used React instead of Vue solely because I'm more familiar with React, although I'm very keen on learning Vue as well.
  - I've used CSS whereever possible for best performance and used best practices for writing Javascript code.
  - The website is fully mobile responsive! I've made sure of that. I'm focused on making a easy to use UI/UX for a user to navigate. I've written all the CSS code by myself without any library.
  - The web-app is progressive as verified by [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/).
